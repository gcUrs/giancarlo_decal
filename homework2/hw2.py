# cd ~ or cd

# git status shows staged/unstaged changes

# 8) What has been the most frustrating error or bug you've encountered in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot and resolve it?
# the most confusing one that happened to me was since I couldn't get help in the moment I had to call for master rather than main, so for me it wasn't much of a bug just a different from the lecture.

# 9) How does cloning a repository differ from pulling from a repository?
# cloning copies the whole repo, while updating just adds the changes that were made 

# 10) Tell me a fun fact!
# I did python code a lot when I was younger in clubs and different groups, but now I forgot mostly everything to do with it!!

#pwd: this prints the current path to the directory; it is useful if you are trying to figure out how you got to the directroy you are in; pwd -> /Users/name/Desktop/etc/

#cd: this allow you to move within the full directory list; you can create a path that you want to execute all at once or you can manually move from one directory to the next (it stands for "change directory"); cd giancarlo_decal (changes my directory to that file)

#ls: this function lists all the files within the directory you are in; this is useful if you want to check out what is in the directory before you make any changes; ls -a (lists all files including hidden ones in a directory)

#mkdir: this funtion creates a new directory; you can visualise this like a new folder on the GUI; mkdir homework1 -> this will create a folder with with that name.

#cp: copies the files and/or directoriies; this is useful to create duplicates if you need localised backups; cp file.py backup.py -> copies the files into backup

#mv: moves/renames files or directories; this is useful for reorganisation; mv oldname.txt newname.txt -> renames that file
